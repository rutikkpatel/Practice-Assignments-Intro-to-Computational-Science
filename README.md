# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project implements linear regression using batch gradient descent. It includes Jupyter Notebook exercises (`C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb`) and a dataset file (`ex1data1.txt`). The goal is to learn the optimal parameters for a linear regression model that predicts the profit of a restaurant based on the population of a city.

## Usage

1. Open `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
3. The notebook includes sections for loading data, implementing cost functions, running gradient descent, and visualizing the results.

## Dataset

The dataset (`ex1data1.txt`) contains two columns: population of a city and the corresponding profit of a restaurant. This dataset is used to train the linear regression model.

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Open the `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially. Adjust parameters and experiment as needed.
